# Google-Calendar-LazyTask


"Quick and Dirty" development speed, no refinement planned from the start.

Manually forked from my [Google-Calendar-Logger-Recap](https://github.com/MatthewHoque/Google-Calendar-Logger-Recap) repo

To work in parallel with my Google-Calendar-Mover for creating quick "Lazy Tasks" on the go, ready to be organized later.

**Similar to the logger I can now use Siri Shortcuts to QUICKLY add tasks to my custom calendar task system**
